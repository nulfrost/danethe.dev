			I specialize in making <span class="font-bold">fast</span> and
			<span class="font-bold">accessible</span> websites using the latest web technologies. Some of the
			tools I use are React/Next.js/Svelte, Node and GraphQL. I’ve taken an interest in DevOps related
			topics / tools and Golang recently and continue to build my knowledge in those areas.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I’m not trying to think of the next billion dollar app idea I enjoy doing other
			activities such as skateboarding, listening to music, playing video games and hanging out with
			my wonderful partner.

			You can check out the things I am tinkering with on my Github. If you would like to get in
			touch feel free to connect on Linkedin or send me an E-mail.
