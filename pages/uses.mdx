Inspired by Wes Bos' [uses](https://uses.tech/) website, I've decided to compile a list of tech / tools that I use.

## Misc

- **Spotify** - where I listen to my sick jamz, seriously I listen to music a lot while working.
- **Alfred** - way better than the default Mac search, highly suggested.
- **Notion** - i use this for note taking, reading lists and planning side projects.

## Dev

- **VSCode** - code editor of choice, I use the [Bearded](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BeardedBear.beardedtheme) theme.
- **iTerm2** - i pretty much install this every time I get a new Mac, it's a very nice terminal emulator.
- **Firefox** - i usually switch browsers every few months but I've been using firefox for a long time now and I have no complaints.
- **Docker** - very useful for spinning up things like databases / putting things in containers to share easily between my desktop and laptop.
- **Figma** - i'm no professional designer but I love using figma, still trying to get a better understanding of designing better user interfaces.

## Tech

- **Phone** - currently rocking the iPhone 12, have used android before but just like using apple products.
- **PC** - my current [PC setup on pcpartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Danex2/saved/#view=XBNLJx).
